So this was a project created for making a remote sprayer device that can be used in various agricultural fields to increase efficency 

So here i have used an ESP32 module as the controller, a Motor driver for controlling the two  12V driver motors
since i have 12v battery i needed a buck convertor to reduce the voltage to a safe 4V for the esp, the relay is used to run the sprayer motor

The controlling is simple and done through the webUI 

(This was an AI generated code that i tweaked for my personal use (cause i am not a html pro))
